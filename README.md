# Pet Adoption Website

This project is a Pet Adoption Website that allows users to view and interact with a collection of pets. The application fetches pet data from an API and displays them categorized by pet types. Users can view details of each pet, "like" pets, and start the adoption process.

## Key Features

- **Category Buttons**: Dynamically fetches and displays pet categories from the API. Users can filter pets by category.

- **Pets Display**: Fetches all pets and displays them in a grid layout. Users can view the name, breed, birth date, gender, and price of each pet.

- **Pet Details Modal**: Displays more detailed information about a selected pet in a modal.
- **Like Functionality**: Allows users to "like" pets, and the liked pets are displayed in a separate section.

- **Sorting**: Pets can be sorted by price in descending order.
- **Adoption Process**: Clicking on the "Adopt" button starts the adoption process.

## ES6 Features Used

This project leverages modern JavaScript ES6 features for cleaner, more efficient code. Below is an explanation of how some of these features are implemented.

### 1. let and const

- **let** is used for variables whose value may change over time (block-scoped).
- **const** is used for constants or variables that should not be reassigned (also block-scoped).

### 2. Arrow Functions

Arrow functions provide a more concise syntax and automatically bind the this value.

### 3. Destructuring

Destructuring is used to extract values from arrays or objects in a concise way.

### 4. Template Strings

Template strings allow for easier string interpolation using backticks ` and ${} for embedding expressions.
